# Building a Delivery Tracking System with QuestDB and Golang

Real-time data tracking is essential for monitoring transportation of goods and services. I used Golang to build an application that simulates GPS movement, ingest the time-series data in QuestDB and thereâ€™s a REST API that exposes the real-time data and metrics. We will leverage Docker to integrate the backend, QuestDB as the time-series database and a data-source for Grafana visualization.
